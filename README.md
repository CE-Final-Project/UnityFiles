## Sprint 1 & 2 : Initial Project & Create Login/Menu Scene
In this scene include login & signup by email, password set default window size to 1600*900 but not scalable. All function isn't work yet, just exit button that worked.

## Sprint 3 & 4 : Study about Creating Map & Pause Menu
Study about creating a scene in game by tilemap and add character that player can interact with it before study about procedural generation map.
### In game Screen

Added some basic controls.

It's time to implement with procedural generation algorithm. First we make 2D array of noise map and map it with biome preset to match it with correct map texture.

## Sprint 5 & 6 : In progress
Next up! Continue work on Random Map Generation Algorithm by add way to random seed and save it locally.
